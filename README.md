# COOS
Core ontology for official statistics


## What is COOS?

The COOS activity is conducted under the umbrella of the "Supporting Standards" [modernisation group](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/hlgbas/Modernisation+Groups) of the [Unece](https://unece.org/) and aims to create a common semantic model and vocabulary for Official Statistics. The ontology will allow a better formalization of the links between the ModernStats models (in particular the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organizations – [GAMSO](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gamso), the Generic Statistical Business Process Model – [GSBPM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsbpm), and the Generic Statistical Information Model – [GSIM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim)), and to connect these models to existing RDF vocabularies like SKOS or PROV-O.


## Products

The ontology is expressed as a [Turtle file](https://github.com/linked-statistics/COOS/blob/master/coos.ttl). This is the authoritative version of the vocabulary.

A [specification document](https://linked-statistics.github.io/COOS/coos.html) is also available. This is work in progress, using the template of a W3C Community Group report for practical purposes, but that does not presume of the form of the final document.


## Current work

Work on the COOS started in 2019 and produced a first version of the ontology. The activity was paused in 2020, and restarted in 2021.

### Roadmap

The projected roadmap is:
  - January: Roadmap for 2021 activities
  - February-April: Articulation with work on GSIM and Metadata Glossary
  - May-June: Work on governance
  - July: Expert review
