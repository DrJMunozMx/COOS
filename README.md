# COOS – Core ontology for official statistics


## What is COOS?

The COOS activity is conducted under the umbrella of the "Supporting Standards" [modernisation group](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/hlgbas/Modernisation+Groups) of the [Unece](https://unece.org/) and aims to create a common semantic model and vocabulary for Official Statistics. The ontology will allow a better formalization of the links between the ModernStats models (in particular the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organizations – [GAMSO](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gamso), the Generic Statistical Business Process Model – [GSBPM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsbpm), and the Generic Statistical Information Model – [GSIM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim)), and help to connect these models to existing RDF vocabularies like [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) or [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/).


## Products

The ontology is expressed as a [Turtle file](https://github.com/linked-statistics/COOS/blob/master/coos.ttl). This is the authoritative version of the vocabulary. See also the [WebOWL visualization](http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linked-statistics/COOS/master/coos.ttl) of the ontology.

A [specification document](https://linked-statistics.github.io/COOS/coos.html) is also available. This is work in progress, using the template of a W3C Community Group report for practical purposes, but that does not presume of the final form of the document.


## Current work

Work on the COOS started in 2019 and produced a first version of the ontology (v0.4). The activity was paused in 2020, and restarted in 2021.
